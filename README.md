# DATA 607 Final Project

In early October, New York announced a zoning strategy to tackle on the rising COVID-19 cases. However, once the unofficial results from the 2020 Presidential election came out, we noticed that
there was a resemblance visually. There were similar patterns between areas that were marked in the red zone, meaning a 7 day positivity rate of over 3%, and areas where the majority voted for one candidate. We wanted to further see if that was just a visual resemblance or if there is a correlation.

We wanted a project that would be focused on current events and Covid and the Presidential election are about as topical as you can get.  We thought combining the Covid rate in New York City with the voting patterns from the 2020 Presidential elections would be interesting to see if there is a correlation between voting for a candidate and the current rate of Covid spread in New York City.  We used COVID data for the week leading up to and including election day.
